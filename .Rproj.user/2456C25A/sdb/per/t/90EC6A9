Click on \nthe Submit button to have the application show you the comparison of both cars.\n\n--- .class #id\n## Main panel\n\nThe main panel shows you what cars that you have selected and also shows\nthe various attributes for each car such as mpg, cylinders, horsepower, etc.\n\nFor example:\n\n```{r}\n# show two cars\ndata(mtcars)\nmtcars$names <- rownames(mtcars)\nf <- c(\"Datsun 710\", \"Valiant\")\nfilter(mtcars, names %in% f)\n\n```\n\n\n--- .class #id\n## Thank you\n\nThank you for using this application.  I am sure that you will agree that\nfor the non-R programmer this is a much easier way of comparing two cars\nagainst each other.",
